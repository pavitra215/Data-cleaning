This project is full of cleaning the raw dataset that I got in kaggle.
For futher process in analytics we need to clean the data.
Here I used MYSQL for the cleaning of raw data.
I created staging data table for the data manipulation.
There are 4 steps for cleaning the data
1.Removing duplicates (never ever touch the raw data, must be created the staging table for the manipulation purpose)
2.Standardiziing the data 
3.Null and blank [ populate the null and blank areas using the other datas that we already have else we need to delete the null and blank spaces ]
4. Removing unnecessary columns 

These are the 4 steps I had used in this project 

By using this final dataset It will be easier for the analysis purpose and explore the data.
